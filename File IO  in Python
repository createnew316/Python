Before we can perform any operation on a file, we must first open it.Python provides open() function.
       f=open('myfile.txt','r')

By default,the open() function returns a file object that can be used to read from or write to the file,depending on the mode.

Modes in file-- There are various modes in which we can open files.

1.read(r)
2.write(w)
3.append(a)
4.create(x)
5.text(t)
6.binary(b)
