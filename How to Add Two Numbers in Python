Type-1  Using the "+" Operator
+ operator is the simplest and most direct way to add two numbers . It performs standard arithmetic addition between two values and returns the result

a=5
b=8
res=a+b
print(res)


Type-2 That a, b input now taking by user using input() function

#taking user input
a=input("First number: ")
b=input("Second number: ")

#Converting input to int and add,any input type we can take int , float 
 res=int(a)+int(b)

print(res)

Explanation: This code takes user input as strings, converts them to floats using float(), adds them and stores the sum in res.

Type-3 Using Function

Functions help organize code into reusable blocks. By defining a function, we can call it multiple times with different values, making our program more structured and efficient.

# function to add two numbers
def add(a,b):
    return a+b

# initializing numbers
a=8
b=9

# calling function
res=add(a,b)

print(res)
