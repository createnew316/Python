importing in python - Module is imported, you can use any of the functions and variables defined in the module by using the dot notation.
            Example- import math
                     result = math.sqrt(5)
                     print(result)
 Note- You can also import multiple function or variable at once by separating them with comma :
           from math import sqrt, pi   or from math import *
             result=sqrt(3)
             print(result)
             print(pi)
