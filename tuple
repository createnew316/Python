In python Tuples- Tuples are ordered collection of data items.They store multiple items in a single variable.Tuple items are separated by commaas and enclose within round brackets().
                  Tuples are unchangeable meaning we can not alter then after creation.

Exmple: tup=(7,5,8,3)
        print(tup)

Some of the cases similar to list.

Operation on Tuples in Python- Tuples are immutable, hence if you want to add, remove or change tuple items,then first you must convert the tuple to a list. Then perform 
                               operation on that list and convert it back to tuple.

Exmple-- countries=("India","Spain","Italy",England")
          temp=list(Countries)
          temp.append("Russia")
          temp.pop(3)
          temp[2]="Finland"
          countries=tuple(temp)
          print(countries)
