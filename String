String--- In python, anything you enclose between single or double quotation marks is considered a string.
            A string is essentially a sequence or array of textual data.
Example- name="Anjali"
         print("Hello"+name)

Note-- It does not matter whether you enclose your string in single or double quotes, the output remains the same.

Multiline String- using '''    ''' that enclose.

Note--- Accessing Characters of a string -
           In python, string is like an array of characters. We can access parts of string by using its index which start form 0.
           example-print(name[0])
We can use for loop also
    for character in name:
       print(character)
