for loop-- for loop can iterate over a sequence of iterable object in python.Iterating over a sequence is nothing but iterating over
            string,list,tuples,set,and dictionaries.

    Eample-- name="Anjali"
             for i in name:
                print(i)

   now while loop- 
         count=5
         while(count>0):
           print(count)
           count=count-1

   now do while loop-
      do{      
           body}while(condition);

break statement--The break statement enables a program to skip over a part of code. A break statement terminates the very loop, it lies within.
continue statement-- The continue statement skips the rest of loop statements and cause the next iteration to occur.
