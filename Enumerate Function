Enumerate Function - The enumerate function is a built-in function in python that allows you to loop over a sequence(such as a list,tuple, or string)
                     and get the index and value of each element  in the sequence at the same time.
              Example- fruits=['apple','banana','mango']
                       for index fruit in enumerate(fruits):
                             print(index,fruit)
