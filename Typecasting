Typecasting --  The conversion of one data type into the other data type is known as type casting or type conversion.
     Python supports a wide variety of functions or methods like : int(),float(),str(),ord(),hex(),oct(),tuple(),set(),list(),dict() etc. for the type casting in python.

Two Type of Typecasting --
  1.Explicit Conversion(Explicit type casting in python)
  2.Implicit Conversion(Implicit type casting in pyhton)

1.Explicit Typecasting- That conversion done by developer , programmer's intervention or manually as per the requriment.

2.Implicit Typecasting- In python do not have same level ordering data type ,some of data type having higher order , some of lower order.While performing any operations on variables with different data type
                           in python,one of variable's data types will be changed to higher data type. So That conversion said to Implicit Typecasting.
