Recursion-- In Python , we know that a function can call other function.IT is even possible for the function to call itself.These 
            type of construct are termed as recursive function.
  Example-- def factorial(n):
              if(n==0 or n==1):
                return 1
              else
                return n*factorial(n-1)

               print(factorial(3))
