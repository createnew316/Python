Function - A function is block of code that performs a specific task whenever it is called.
   There are two type of functions: 1. Built-in function 2.User-defined function

1.Buil-in functions-These function are defined and pre-coded in python. Some example of built-in function are as follow:
          min(),max(),len(),sum(),type(),range(),dic(),list(),tuple(),set(),print() etc.
          
2.User-defined function-- We can create functions to perform specific tasks as per our needs.
          syntax: def function_name(parameters):
                       pass #here is pass mean pass of statement
                       # code statement
                       
                      #function calling
                     function_name(parameters)   

There are four types of arguments that we can provide in a function:
1.Default arguments
2.keyword arguments
3.variable arguments
4.Required arguments
