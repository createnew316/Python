The simplest way to find minimum of two numbers in Python is by using built-in min() function.

a=16
b=3

print(min(a,b))

Output-3

Explanation:

min() function compares the two numbers a and b.
So, it returns 3 as the smaller value

Type-2
Using Conditional Statements

a=16
b=3

if a<b:
   print(a)
else:
  print(b)
