String Methods-- Python provides a set of built-in methods.
  Note-- Strings are immutable.Here we can not change string, but create a new string and change the string.

1.upper()-convert to string upper case. 
    Eaxmple-- name="Anjali"
              print(name.upper())
 2.lower()-covert to string lower case.
             print(name.lower())
 3.rstrip()--remove any trailing characters.
             name="Anjali!!!!"
             print(name.rstrip("!"))
4.replace()- replace the string
              print(name.replace("Anjali","Ajay"))
5.capitalize()- The capitalize() method turns only the first character of string to uppercase and rest other character of string are turned of string 
                 lower case,if first character already upper that method is not effect.
                print(name.capitalize())
6.center()-This method aligns the string to center as per the parameter.
           print(name.center())
7.count()-given the number of times value occured.
          print(name.count("a"))
8.find()-The find() method searches for the first occurance of given value and return the index where it is present. given value absent from string 
          retrun -1.
           print(name.find("a")

9.index()- The index() method same like find(), but here if given value absent ,so throwing exception , not return -1.
            print(name.index("A"))
